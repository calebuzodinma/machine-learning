This report discusses the challenges of predicting energy consumption in residential buildings in
order to promote greater energy efficiency and conservation. For most parts, sustainability has
become the way to go in the energy sector. There have been many sustainable initiatives such as
electrifying public transportation and building electric vehicle infrastructure. For this report,
predicting energy consumption in a bid to conserve energy and bring greater energy efficiency
will be challenges that will be discussed.
This study used a dataset from the government of Canada, which contained energy consumption
data of households in various provinces of Canada. The dataset for this project used electricity as
its main energy source and residential buildings as its case study for infrastructure. Other energy
sources, such as oil, gas, and solar, were not used as adding them would be too broad to quantify
and would need a considerable amount of time to analyze. This was done to narrow down the
datasets and to avoid any sort of complexity. Linear regression, Support vector regression, and
polynomial regression were the machine learning methods used to predict the energy
consumption forecast.
The methodology of the project followed a sequence of steps: data collection, data
preprocessing, algorithm selection, and model evaluation. Model validation techniques, such as
train-test split and performance evaluation, were employed to ensure that the model can perform
well with new data. The limitations of the study include the absence of weather data and the use
of deep learning to reduce bias. Overall, at least two models were found to be predictive and
helped conserve energy.
